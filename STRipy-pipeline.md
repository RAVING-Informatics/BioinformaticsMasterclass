# STRipy-pipeline
In this tutorial, we will practice our ability to set-up and run a simple informatics pipeline that runs on CLI.
The pipeline we will use is STRipy, which was created by Andreas Halman with the aim of simplifying the process of genotyping known STR loci.
To learn more about STRipy, there is a [website]([url](https://stripy.org/)), and an accompanying [paper]([url](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.24382)) for detailed methods. The website contains a curated reference database of the known STR expansions, including the gene implicated, repeat region, repeat thresholds, disease association, and the number of repeats in a set of ~2500 unaffected controls.  

## Part 1 - Set up and install STRipy
Whenever there is a new tool that you want to use, you need to find the repository in which the program code is stored, along with the relevent documentation that describes how and in what environment you can install it. Often, this repository is made using GitHub, and the link to the repository is available in the paper/website associated with the tool/program. Otherwise, you can search for the author's name in GitHub, or run a simple Google search.
